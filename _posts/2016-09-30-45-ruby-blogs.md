Ruby was developed in the mid-1990s by [Yukihiro Matsumoto](https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz?lang=en), as an object-oriented scripting language, which was more robust and flexible than either Python or Perl. The release of the Rails framework in 2004 catapulted Ruby to fame outside Japan and since then a passionate open-source community has developed. Today the language is used in production at many tech companies.

Ruby’s importance is reflected in the [demand for Ruby developers](https://app.honeypot.io/users/sign_up?ruby-blog) among European startups. On Honeypot, Ruby is the second most popular language, following JavaScript, and according to our data, the average salary for a Ruby developer in Berlin is between [€48,500 and €57,300](https://blog.honeypot.io/how-much-does-a-developer-earn-in-berlin/), though it is higher for more senior developers.
