Moin Moin Hamburg! Honeypot's here!  

<!--more--> 

I am pleased to announce today Honeypot is officially launching in Hamburg.


### A city with a strong digital foundation

With strong media roots, the highest concentration of games development companies in Germany and a rapidly growing startup community, Hamburg is an obvious choice for Honeypot. 

There are over 500 innovative digital startups operating in Hamburg, including notable German startups, such as Xing, Germany’s biggest career network, Parship, an online dating site, and Qype, Europe’s largest reviews network (now owned by Yelp.) Big players in the games industry, like InnoGames, BigPoint and GoodGames, also call the city home.


### A growing VC desintation 

According to EY, startups in Hamburg increased their materially funding from USD 540 million in 2014 to USD 852 million in 2015. Not surprising then that we have seen a clear demand for talented developers in the city. Honeypot is already working with some exciting startups, including [TripRebel][4], [BytroLabs][1], [Wunder][2], and [XYRALITY][3], among others. 


### A great city for developers

For developers interested in working in Hamburg, the boosts a strong network of support, with frequent meetups and conferences.  The city is also famous for its relaxed lifestyle. 

Honeypot will be having its first event, [HRinTech Hamburg][5], in the city on June 16th at Shhared co-working space.
