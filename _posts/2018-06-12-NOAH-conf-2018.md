Unless you‚Äôve been living under a rock or quite simply have no interest in business, the chances are you‚Äôve heard about the **NOAH18 Conference** and know this year‚Äôs Berlin edition took place on the *6th-7th of June at the Tempodrom!*

And fortunately for those of you who weren‚Äôt able to make it, the Honeypot team was on site to soak up the atmosphere and capture all the action in order to put together a nifty recap of the conference and basically make you regret not coming! (*There‚Äôs always next year* üòú)

Without any further ado, *what made #NOAH18 Berlin so darn great?*

**1,500 startups.. 700 investors..** and a unique mix of **European CEOs** from large corporations and top-funded startups. That in itself is pretty amazing if you ask us, but having the chance to attend talks and presentations from online giants such as **Facebook, Uber, App Annie, Rocket Internet** and others quite simply took things to a whole other level.

But as well as the usual suspects we‚Äôre all familiar with by now, NOAH18 also **highlighted a wide range of exciting startups** who each showcased their innovations in elevator pitches on the Startup Stage.

Oh and if that wasn‚Äôt comprehensive enough to please all attendees, **the one and only Al Gore** (former US Vice President & Chairman of Generation IM) even gave an extremely insightful talk about *climate change, sustainable business and the digital revolution*. Make sure you check out his presentation in the video below!

The conference was jam-packed with interesting talks from inspirational business leaders, and there was even time for a **10-way Fintech startup competition** powered by Visa.

And if you ever had a sudden urge to start learning new skills, various interactive **workshops were organised by the likes of Wochit and Google!**

<br />

We really enjoyed attending the conference and mingling with other industry experts, and strongly recommend that you give one of NOAH‚Äôs conferences a try. **NOAH London** will take place on the *30th and 31st of October* and **NOAH Tel Aviv** is only 10 months away, but you can always just sit tight and wait for the next Berlin edition which should be around the same period in 2019!

Congratulations to NOAH on organising such a wide-ranging and insightful conference and a massive thank you for having us!

We‚Äôll definitely see you again next year! **CHEERS!**
