At Honeypot, we talk to hundreds of developers each week, who keep us up-to-date on trends in technology and tools. We have been paying close attention to the blogs they recommend and to celebrate the diverse world of frontend, we created this (semi-) definitive list of frontend blogs! We’ve also tracked up-and-coming blogs since this article’s publication and added them to the list to make this the definitive 2020 guide to frontend blogs. Topics covered range from CSS and HTML to modern JavaScript MVC frameworks and User Experience.
