There are between [1,900 and 2,600 tech startups](http://blog.honeypot.io/amsterdam-tech-map/) in the Amsterdam-Startup Delta, the geographical triangle, which covers Amsterdam, the Hague and Eindhoven. Whatsmore, large tech companies such as Uber, Tesla, Avazu, Elastic and Atlassian, have major offices in the Dutch Capital. That means a lot of demand for developers.

We gathered data from our platform to see the average salaries offered by companies to developers in Amsterdam. This data is taken from 300 offers which have been sent in the last four months.

According to [Compass](http://startup-ecosystem.compass.co/ser2015/), the proportion of developers with prior experience is lower than in other European startup hubs.

For startups based in Amsterdam, hiring developers remains one of the biggest challenges to growth.
