If you haven't so far, it might be the right time to think about hiring junior developers. With the help of the Investitionsbank Berlin (IBB) you can now get a grant to support your new “Innovationsassistent”. 

<!--more-->

IBB’s Innovationsassistent program is dedicated to small and medium sized companies (SMEs) that want to hire a recent graduate (up to two years) of technical university or an institution that provides a stated recognized degree. 

### What is IBB? 

IBB is a business development and promotion bank of the Federal Land of Berlin. IBB is actively helping Berlin to become an established center for business and industry. 

### What is this the IBB Innovationsassistent program about? 

In a nutshell, IBB will subsidy half of your Innovationsassistent’s gross salary. Keep in mind that the maximum grant amounts to €20,000.

### What are the rules of the IBB? 


 First of all, your company has to be registered in Berlin. On top of that, your company should be innovative and technologically-oriented. If it isn’t, then the role you are offering to your Innovationsassistent must be technology related (easy with developers!). 

You can apply for a maximum of two Innovationsassistent at the same time. They should never be replacing other employees in your company. Meaning - they must be hired for newly created roles. 

### What is the process? 

The application must be submitted to IBB prior to signing the contract with your new Innovationsassistent. Good news is - you can do it online and anytime!

 If your documents are complete, IBB will make a decision within 6-8 weeks. If it’s positive, you have 3 months to finalize the hire. 

If you think this could work for you please refer to IBB’s website where you can find all the neccessary information together with [these application forms][1]
