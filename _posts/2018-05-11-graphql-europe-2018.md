We’re absolutely thrilled to have been able to reunite so many household names, but take just as much pride in giving some of the industry’s up-and-coming experts the exposure they deserve.
 
**Below we’ve highlighted some great talks you won’t want to miss!**

<br />

**Kyle Daigle, Director of Ecosystem Engineering at Github**  
*Regular talk: Fast, Slow, Beautiful, Ugly: Building GitHub's Platform*


<p align="left"><img alt="Kyle Daigle" src="/assets/images/kyle-daigle.png" style="width:60% !important;"></p><br>
*“GitHub has had a REST API for almost 10 years and it's powered hundreds of thousands of integrations. In the last 2 years, GitHub has been reinvesting in its platform and brought a new, public GraphQL API to market. Additionally, GitHub's engineers build, maintain, and use their own GraphQL APIs to power GitHub.com itself. In this talk, I will share why GitHub is enabling integrators to build more powerful integrations, why GraphQL is an important part of the strategy, and all the joy, tears, bad code, and amazing accomplishments of our journey.”*

Kyle is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kdaigle), [Github](https://github.com/kdaigle) (well, uhh) and [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/kyledaigle), where he shares previous talks about GraphQL and the Github API.

<br />

**Arnaud Rinquin, Full-Stack Developer at Slite**  
*Lightning talk: GraphQL Subscriptions in their untold glory: Building a public Webhook API*


<p align="left"><img alt="Arnaud Rinquin" src="/assets/images/arnaud-rinquin.jpeg" style="width:60% !important;"></p><br>
*“If you’ve ever used or designed a webhook API, you must have noticed that every one of them is a (usually messy) unique snowflake. Using GraphQL Subscriptions is the solution to fix all that, we've done it and it's much simpler than you'd think!”*

Arnaud is a French software engineer who’s specialized in crafting quality applications for web and mobile. Before joining Slite, Arnaud worked in London for Qumu and Songkick. You can find him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arnaudrinquin), [Github](https://github.com/ArnaudRinquin) and his [personal website](https://arnaud.rocks/) for more info!

**Daniel Woelfel, Software Engineer at Facebook & Founder of Precursor**  
*Regular talk: Teaching GraphQL*


<p align="left"><img alt="Daniel Woelfel" src="/assets/images/daniel-woelfel.jpeg" style="width:60% !important;"></p><br>
*“GraphQL is designed to be easy to use, but newcomers to GraphQL are often tripped up by common problems and misconceptions. I'll cover how to teach GraphQL in a way that gets newbies excited and helps them overcome the mental hurdles that prevent them from being productive with GraphQL.”*

Daniel has been a software engineer at Facebook for almost 3 years and founded his own prototyping app back in 2014. He’s on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/danielwoelfel) and [Github](https://github.com/dwwoelfel) and has previously given talks at [React Vienna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUY8mcLvXnQ) and [ReactiveConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgJyI1BKmHQ).

<br />

**Jon Wong, Senior Software Engineer at Coursera**  
*Lightning talk: Supercharge Your GraphQL Development*


<p align="left"><img alt="Jon Wong" src="/assets/images/jon-wong.jpeg" style="width:60% !important;"></p><br>
*“Supercharge your GraphQL development with the linting, formatting, and static analysis tools you need to write cleaner and more reliable GraphQL.”*

As part of his role at Coursera, Jon works on frontend infrastructure and specializes  in driving GraphQL adoption across web and mobile clients, specifically in React. You can find him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jnwng) and [Github](https://github.com/jnwng).

<br />

**Mike Solomon, Software Engineer at Twitter**  
*Regular talk: Transpiling GraphQL instead of writing customized server code*


<p align="left"><img alt="Mike Solomon" src="/assets/images/mike-solomon.jpg" style="width:40% !important;"></p><br>
*“GraphQL specifies what data and response shape we need and not how to get and reshape that data. At Twitter, we automatically translate GraphQL queries into code that efficiently specifies the how as well! See how we keep our API uniform and extend it without writing or deploying new code.”*

Before joining Twitter, Mike was a software engineer and backend server lead at Elevate (previously MindSnacks). He’s on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/msol) and [Github](https://github.com/msolomon) and has even released his own [indie mobile game](https://playroadtripadventures.com/).

<br />

**Rob Richard, Associate Director of Frontend Engineering at 1stdibs.com**  
*Lightning talk: Write your own GraphQL Client*


<p align="left"><img alt="Rob Richard" src="/assets/images/rob-richard.jpeg" style="width:60% !important;"></p><br>
*“Have you ever asked "why do I need a library like Apollo or Relay to use GraphQL?". They can seem complex and intimidating. In this talk we will build our own client from the ground up to get a deep understanding of the advanced features these libraries offer.”*

Prior to joining 1stdibs.com in 2013, Rob was an IT analyst for Barclays Capital and worked as a web consultant for various clients. You can find him on [Github](https://github.com/robrichard) or check out his [website](https://robrichard.net/) for more info!

<br />

**Sasha Solomon, Senior Software Engineer at Medium**  
*Regular talk: 2 Fast 2 Furious: migrating Medium’s codebase without slowing down*


<p align="left"><img alt="Sasha Solomon" src="/assets/images/sasha-solomon.jpg" style="width:40% !important;"></p><br>
*“After 5 years, we're building the next generation infrastructure at Medium with GraphQL and we're doing it without slowing product development AND we're incrementally gaining benefits from the new system. See how we take advantage of GraphQL to enable widespread yet gradual architectural change!”*

Sasha is currently the Tech Lead on the Platforms team helping build the next generation infrastructure for Medium with GraphQL (Sangria + Scala) and React.js. You can find her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sachee/) and [Github](https://github.com/sachee/), or check out the content of [her talk on Medium!](https://medium.engineering/2-fast-2-furious-migrating-mediums-codebase-without-slowing-down-84b1e33d81f4)

<br />

**Michael Hunger, Head of Developer Relations at Neo4j**  
*Lightning talk: Not your Dad's Java - Building a GraphQL Server with Kotlin and graphql-java*


<p align="left"><img alt="Michael Hunger" src="/assets/images/michael-hunger.jpg" style="width:60% !important;"></p><br>
*“Building APIs in Java is not exciting. That changes if you throw GraphQL and Kotlin into the mix. The great library (thanks Andy) and powerful, concise language make it easy to build a GraphQL server in a few lines of code. With co-routines and lambdas as a glue, you get a neat, scalable backend.”*

As caretaker of the Neo4j community and ecosystem, Michael especially loves to work with graph-related projects, users and contributors. He’s on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mesirii) and [Github](https://github.com/jexp), and regularly writes about [GraphQL on the Neo4j blog](https://neo4j.com/blog/contributor/michael-hunger/).
