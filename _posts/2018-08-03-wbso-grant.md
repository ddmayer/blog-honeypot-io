Building a great team can be expensive, particularly in the field of engineering where seasoned developers with over 8 years of experience can [earn upwards of 58k per year](http://blog.honeypot.io/how-much-do-developers-earn-in-amsterdam-2018/). 

But before you whip out your bank statements and start questioning the financial viability of your business, know that the **Dutch government regularly supports local organizations** and offers various grants and incentives to companies in the tech sector.

<!--more-->

One of those is the **WBSO grant, i.e the Dutch Government’s Act for the Stimulation of Research and Development.**

<br />

## What is the WBSO?

<br />

The WBSO is essentially a **Research and Development (R&D) tax credit** that allows eligible companies to **pay lower wage tax** and **lower national insurance contributions**. It’s delivered by the [Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy](https://www.government.nl/ministries/ministry-of-economic-affairs-and-climate-policy) and is intended to provide entrepreneurs with an incentive to invest in research.

<br />

## Why should you apply for the WBSO?

<br />

With the WBSO, you can benefit from **lower wage costs** and **reduce the cost of other R&D expenditures**, such as the purchasing of research equipment or prototypes. With regards to the actual savings the WBSO promises, the [WBSO manual 2018](https://english.rvo.nl/sites/default/files/2018/03/Manual%20WBSO%202018.pdf) states that “the deduction amounts to **32% of the first €350,000** of the total underlying R&D cost and **14% of the remaining costs**.” The savings are even more substantial for startups, for whom the tax deduction **can amount to 40%**.

<br />

## Are you eligible for the WBSO grant?

<br />

In a nutshell, the WBSO is intended for Dutch companies (registered at the [Dutch Chamber of Commerce](https://business.gov.nl/about-us/netherlands-chamber-of-commerce/)) that employ people responsible for **Research & Development projects**.
In order to be eligible for the WBSO grant, the following conditions must also be met:

<br />

  * The proposed R&D activities have to actually take place in your own company
  * The technological development you’re embarking on is new to your organization
  * The development is accompanied by technical problems
  * You’ve yet to start working on the R&D project (as the WBSO application needs to be submitted in advance)

<br />

You can find [more information about the conditions of eligibility](https://english.rvo.nl/subsidies-programmes/wbso) on the official website of the Netherlands Enterprise Agency, part of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy.
