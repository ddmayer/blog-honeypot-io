For the European tech industry, finding and retaining talent from abroad has become one of the most pressing issues of the day. I sat down with the relocation team at **GetYourGuide**, named one of 2018’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company, to chat about **retention strategies for international talent**.

As the leading booking platform in Europe for incredible travel experiences, GetYourGuide relies heavily on international talent to fuel their success. **In total, [92 percent](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/seltener-seltener-software-entwickler-berlins-start-ups-leiden-unter-fachkraeftemangel/24676546.html) of the IT employees in the Berlin office (and 88 percent of total employees) come from outside of Germany**. According to the relocation team, this diversity is the key to a culture of innovation.

This year, the team at GetYourGuide have already successfully relocated over 35 new employees, and plan to relocate an additional 100 in the coming months. So how do they make sure that the candidates they have put time and effort into hiring actually stick around?

## Fly Them In! 

<br>

GetYourGuide’s talent retention strategy starts even before an offer has been made. One of the best ways to ensure that your new hire will be happy in their new city is to bring them there! Flying a candidate in for an in-person interview allows them the chance to experience not only your company culture in person, but also life in their potential new home. It’s important to make sure they are going to love it before making the final commitment. 

The relocation team at GetYourGuide recommends flying in not only the candidate but *the whole family* whenever possible. As you’ll see below, buy-in from the family is critically important in ensuring that your new hire sticks around. The investment you make in bringing them in - especially for high level positions - will pay off when your new hire not only accepts your offer, but contributes to your success for years to come.

Once you’ve made your decision and extended an offer, what barriers do relocated employees commonly face? 

<br>

## Travel Assistance

<br>

The number one thing that new hires at GetYourGuide always appreciate is travel help. The team at GetYourGuide allows new hires to choose their own flight, and then handles the booking on their behalf. 

Something as simple as checking details about the flight can ease so much of the stress related to moving. Are they travelling with family and need seats together? How much baggage do they need to check in? What about dietary restrictions, or extra leg room? 

The relocation team is sure to check each of these details in advance. These are things new hires are often too busy to think of, but appreciate immensely. It can also remove some of the financial pressure of relocation (and if you ask GetYourGuide, the upfront cost is well worth it to create a great first experience for new hires).

## Housing

<br>

The [housing situation in Berlin](http://blog.honeypot.io/15-tips-finding-a-flat-berlin/) is undoubtedly tricky. The demand is high (and getting higher every day), and the supply is constrained by building permits and city ordinances. 

For tech talents relocating to Germany, the difficulty of finding an apartment in the first place is compounded by the fact that many available apartments are offered unfurnished. This is especially tough for those coming to Germany with a limited number of belongings. 

GetYourGuide has taken a multi-pronged approach to tackling this issue. It’s important to take into account each employee’s individual needs to find the best initial housing solution: 

* Is it a single person, or a family? 
* Are they shipping furniture, or arriving with only a suitcase? 
* Will there be children or pets accompanying them? 

For newly arrived talents, GetYourGuide has set up an apartment building owned by the company that can house several new employees for a short period. For those not able to use this housing option, GetYourGuide also partners with local realtors to find furnished short-term accommodations. This allows the new employee to settle in to their new city for a month or two while looking for a more permanent flat. 

They also take care to provide information on resources such as [eBay Kleinanzeigen](https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/) where newly arrived employees can find discounted furniture to fill a new apartment.

## The Partner

<br>

The single biggest issue that international talents cite as a reason for leaving a new job (and sometimes leaving the country entirely)? An unhappy partner. What often happens is the partner with a new job has somewhere exciting to go to every day, is constantly meeting new colleagues, and has a chance to get to know the new city… while the partner on a family reunification visa may be sitting at home feeling isolated in an unfamiliar new country where they don’t speak the language.  

Companies can do a lot to ensure that talents stay with them by making an effort to support the entire family. This includes (but is of course not limited to): 

* **Inviting the spouse to come along for the final interview in Berlin.** As we discussed above, It’s important that both partners have a chance to see the new city and explore what the move will mean for each of their lives. If both partners are prepared for and happy with the move, it’s much more likely that your new hire will stay in town. 

* **Assisting the spouse with their job search.** For most families these days, two incomes is no longer a luxury but rather a requirement. This is especially true in a new city where a family can incur additional expenses in the process of settling in. Apart from the monetary value, finding a job in a new city can also provide a sense of purpose and motivation, and a way to meet new people in an unfamiliar place. 

* **Invite the spouse to company events.** Especially for partners who have not yet found a job in the new city, moving to a new country can be an isolating experience. Extending an invitation to join company events and networking opportunities allows partners to feel included in your new hire’s excitement, and provides an essential tie to the new city that will help your new hire put down roots. 

<br>

## The Children

<br>

Finding a daycare for little ones presents yet another challenge for recently relocated families. Kita (short for [Kindertagesstätte](https://www.german-way.com/history-and-culture/education/the-german-school-system/) is the German system of daycare for children ages 3 to 5. It’s an invaluable aid to families with young children, allowing both parents to work and to leave the house during the day - an essential part of integrating into a new culture. 

In Berlin in particular, and in many other German cities, Kita can be nearly as competitive as finding a university! In fact, many families begin their Kita search as soon as they learn they are expecting. The situation varies from district to district, but in Berlin it is especially difficult in trendy and young districts such as Prenzlauer Berg and Mitte. 

Companies can go a long way in supporting newly arrived families by assisting with Kita search and providing guidance on options. At GetYourGuide, the relocation team works to find suitable housing for young families that will allow them better access to Kita programs in their neighborhood. They also make sure that families are aware of their legal rights and options when it comes to Kita.

## The Pets

<br>

Although less common than travelling with a partner and children, many relocated talents also bring beloved pets to their new city. In these cases, it’s helpful to provide as much information as possible in advance to make sure this transition is a smooth one. 

Throughout the process of relocating new employees, the team at GetYourGuide has encountered many surprises - including an employee who wished to move with 8 cats! (As it turns out, there is a limit to how many animals you can fly with before the airline considers you an animal trafficker… that number is 6.) In general, employers can take the following steps to ensure new arrivals and their fur-babies are prepared: 

* **Candidates should be aware in advance of [how animals travel on planes](https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/travel-safely-your-pet-car-airplane-ship-or-train), as well as the risk they are taking by transporting their pets this way.** (It’s not uncommon for animals to have traumatic experiences flying, and some unfortunately do not survive the journey at all.) 

* **Candidates should also be well informed of what life will be like [owning a pet in Germany](https://www.settle-in-berlin.com/life-with-pets-in-germany-what-you-need-to-know/).** What are the regulations for registering a pet? Where is the closest emergency veterinarian? In many cities there is also a pet tax for certain breeds. As an employer, informing your new hire about these regulations in advance can help avoid unwanted surprises later on.

## Go the Extra Mile 

<br>

If you really want to “wow” your new hire, there are a few areas where you can really go the extra mile to make them feel at home in a new city.

* **Does your new hire have furniture or other household items to ship to Germany?** Why not take one more thing off their plate by providing a list of shipping companies that you know are reputable. You can also recommend a good storage facility to house their belongings while they look for a permanent home. 

* **Help them to up a bank account in advance so there is no delay when it comes to the first paycheck.** Several banks offer online banking that you can set up from abroad, and that will allow you to withdraw cash at any local ATM without fees. 

* **Designate a German-speaking colleague to help out when small things come up.** This is often as simple as helping your new hire to read a letter they’ve received from their health insurance or landlord, or helping to book an appointment over the phone. 

<br>

## The Buddy System 

<br>

One of the best ways that you can support an international talent’s move to Germany is to put them in contact with another employee who has moved from abroad. They can share stories and support each other in their adventures. At Honeypot, we use the “buddy system,” assigning each new hire a “buddy” who is responsible for showing them around the office, introducing them to their new colleagues, answering questions, and checking in periodically to make sure they are happy at work.

*Is this your first international hire? Let us know and Honeypot can help you put your new hire in touch with someone who has already made the leap at a similar company!*

## Takeaways

<br>

Clearly GetYourGuide has invested a lot of time and energy into making sure the talent they hire from abroad sticks around long-term. Even before an offer has been made, they are hard at work ensuring that their potential new employee will be happy in their new city, and that the entire family is onboard with the move. From the travel plans to the first days in Germany, GetYourGuide’s relocation team anticipates their new hire’s potential needs and does everything they can to make the move smooth and painless. Once they’re settled in Germany, the integration process kicks into high gear as GetYourGuide does their best to make sure the entire family (including pets) is taken care of. 

As German tech companies prepare to welcome international developers in ever-increasing numbers, we hope these tips will help you to create a lasting impression for your next hires. 

*As always, happy hiring!*
