Here are the key takeaways:

### 1. Get your Dutch visa!

* EU Citizens don't need a visa to work in the Netherlands
* Graduates of Dutch universities can use the orientation permit to work or seek employment for up to a year
* Highly-skilled migrants (this includes developers) qualify for an accelerated visa process. Check with the [Immigration and Naturalisation Service][1] (IND) for a list of companies sponsoring the visa.

### 2. Register with BSN for your Dutch residence permit

* [Expatcenter][2]: if you are a highly skilled migrant worker go here for your BSN. Your employer will organize the appointment.
* [Stadsloket Centrum][3]: if you are an EU-citizen go here for your BSN. These administration offices can be found in the district where you live.
