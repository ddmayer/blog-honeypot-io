**The EU Blue Card** is an EU-wide work permit which allows highly-skilled non-EU citizens to live and work in the EU. Besides that, it offers many other benefits to potential card holders that might be attractive to you - **Let´s explore what is in for you once you land your dream job!**

In general, the Blue Card is valid in all EU-member states, **except Denmark, Ireland, and the UK.** Initially, it is issued for a limited period of four years at most. If the employment contract has a term of fewer than four years, the Blue Card is issued for the duration of the employment contract plus three months.

<br />

## Why was the Blue Card introduced?

<br />

The idea was to fill skill shortages in Europe’s labor markets, cut bureaucracy, and promote alignment within the EU by making it easier for non-EU citizens to move between member states. 

The Blue Card was introduced in 2012 in Germany and since then has become the most attractive residence title. Understandably, **Germany has been its most active supporter, awarding [over 85% of the total Blue Cards in Europe in 2017!](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=migr_resbc1&lang=en)**

<br />

## Does it apply across the EU?

<br />

Many applicants believe that the EU Blue Card is handled like the US Green Card, which allows the holder to live and work anywhere in the United States. 

While the name similarity can be misleading, it is important to note that obtaining a Blue Card in Germany does not automatically mean you can move and work freely across Europe.

The information below will guide you through all the perks the EU Blue Card could offer to you and your family once the requirements are fulfilled and the application process is successful - **Enjoy! :)**
